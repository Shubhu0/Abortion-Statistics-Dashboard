# Abortion-Statistics-Dashboard
A visualization dashboard that better helps understand the Abortion Statistics collected over the years


The topic for the Project is based on the Abortion Statistics performed by the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Guttmacher Institute. The CDC first began
abortion surveillance in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining
legally induced abortions.
To dive deeper into this project, we first need to trace the steps back to its origins and understand
when abortion was first legalized. Abortion got legalized for the first time in the year 1969 â€“
1970, in only five states, those five states being Alaska, California, Hawaii, New York, and
Washington. It was only four years after the first legalization, that the Supreme Court Roe v.
Wade decided to make abortion legal all across the nation.
The data gathered is the Abortion Surveillance Statistics datasets which are open source on the
CDC website and the Guttmacher Institute.
These articles' data allowed program designers and politicians to pinpoint the demographics of
women who abort the most frequently. Induced abortion is primarily caused by unintended
pregnancy. It is possible to decrease unwanted pregnancies and further lower the number of
abortions carried out in the US by expanding access to and use of effective contraception.
